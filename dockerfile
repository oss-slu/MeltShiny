# Docker Image is built in `deploy-shiny.yaml` file in the `.github/workflows` folder.

# This Dockerfile is used to build the Docker image for the MeltShiny app.

# Use the Rocker Docker image with R 4.2.1 and Shiny Server pre-installed - this works best if you are not using an Apple Sillicon chip. 
FROM rocker/shiny:latest

# Run the following commands to install the necessary packages for MeltShiny. It installs everything that is needed in the install.R code.
RUN install2.r rsconnect dplyr DT ggplot2 glue openxlsx plotly remotes methods ggrepel MeltR shiny shinyjs shinythemes 

# MeltR is not on CRAN, so it needs to be installed from GitHub
RUN Rscript -e "remotes::install_github('JPSieg/MeltR')"

# Copy the application files into the Docker image
COPY code/app.R /app.R
COPY code/install.R /install.R
COPY code/global.r /global.r
COPY code/server.r /server.r
COPY code/ui.R /ui.R
COPY code/deploy.R /deploy.R

# After all the necessary files have been copied, run the deploy.R script to start the deployment of the Shiny app
CMD Rscript deploy.R



# To test the Docker image, you can run the following commands:
# Go to root directory and run `docker build -t meltshiny .` to build the Docker image
# Then do `docker run --network host meltshiny` to run the container
